This repository contains several [reusable GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) that can be referenced when developing Shopware projects.

## Usage

The above link should provide the necessary information for using these workflows within your project, but generally you can call a workflow like this:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-reusable-workflow:
    uses: TorqIT/shopware-github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/workflow-file.yml@sha
    # If the reusable workflow requires inputs:
    with:
      input1: value
      input2: value
    # If the reusable workflow requires secrets:
    secrets:
      secret1: value
      secret2: value
```

where `workflow-file.yml` refers to the actual workflow file you wish to use, and `sha` refers to a commit SHA, tag (e.g. `v7`) or branch name (e.g. `main`). This repository uses a semantic versioning scheme, so referring to a major tag (e.g. `v7`) will allow you to automatically get fixes/non-breaking improvements.

### Environment variables

At present, reusable workflows can access [GitHub Environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) variables (i.e. the `vars` context), and therefore do not need these values to be passed as inputs. However, they cannot yet access environment secrets, so these need to be passed by the caller as demonstrated above.

### Self-hosted runners

All workflows contain an optional `RUNNER` input that will accept the name of a self-hosted runner. If this parameter is not provided, an `ubuntu-latest` GitHub runner will be used.

Per [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#using-self-hosted-runners), these workflows can only access self-hosted runners in the [Torq IT organization](https://github.com/torqit). As a workaround, you can fork this repository into your organization in order to utilize your organization's self-hosted runners.
